# ⚔️ Genshin Character Statistics Dashboard

An interactive data analysis project exploring **Genshin Impact character stats** — using real data from the Genshin API/Fandom Wiki.  
Built with **Python, pandas, and Streamlit**, this project visualizes and compares characters by their base stats and predicts potential damage output using a simple regression model.

## 📘 Overview
The goal of this project was to practice:
- Fetching and cleaning structured API data.
- Building visual dashboards with filters.
- Applying simple ML regression to game data.

Even though it was a short experiment, it helped me understand the pipeline from **data collection → preprocessing → visualization → modeling**.
